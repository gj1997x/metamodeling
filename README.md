Target Model: Embedded System - Vehicle Monitoring System
#### The labtwo file contains the META MODEL. The Testing contains the instances and the design of my graphical meta model tool.

### VMS - Vehicle Monitoring System
The Vehicle Monitoring System (VMS) is a comprehensive solution designed to enhance vehicle safety, efficiency, and connectivity. It combines a range of embedded systems  to monitor vehicle performance, anticipate maintenance needs, ensure operational safety, and provide real-time data to drivers and remote monitoring centers.

### Key Components:

- Embedded System: Its the central processing unit that containes many key components such as the sensors, actuators, microcontrolls, motors, memory and batteries inorder for performing data processing and provide the expected actions.
- Microcontroller: It mainly processes data from sensors, controlls actuators and handle communication protocls.
